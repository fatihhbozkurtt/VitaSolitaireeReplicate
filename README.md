## 🧠 Development Decisions

### ✅ Accessibility First  
Fonts, buttons, and interactions were scaled up and made more visible for aging eyes and limited dexterity. This includes:
- Large tappable areas  
- High contrast cards and background  
- Smooth animations and calm transitions  

### 🔁 Reusable Card System  
Cards are implemented as modular components, allowing easy logic for dragging, stacking, and snapping to foundation piles or tableau columns.

### 🧩 State Management  
Game state is managed via a central controller to handle actions like dealing cards, undoing moves, and checking for win conditions efficiently.
